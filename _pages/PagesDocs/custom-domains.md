When you are ready to share your site with the public you can add your own custom domain. Please make sure you have completed all of the requirements in [before you launch](/documentation/before-you-launch#requirements) before continuing.

If you are migrating an existing site to Federalist and wish to minimize downtime, see [minimizing downtime](#minimizing-downtime)

It is possible to add up to 2 custom domains for your site, each one requires the completion of the following 3 steps:

1. [Configure your DNS](#configure-your-dns)
    * [Determine your domain type](#determine-your-domain-type)
    * [Adding an apex domain](#adding-an-apex-domain)
        - [Your DNS provider supports `ALIAS` records](#your-dns-provider-supports-alias-records)
        - [Your DNS provider does **not** support `ALIAS` records](#your-dns-provider-does-not-support-alias-records)
    * [Adding a subdomain](#adding-a-subdomain)
        - [Minimizing downtime](#minimizing-downtime)
2. [Notify Federalist](#notify-federalist)
3. [Update your Site Settings](#update-your-site-settings)

## Configure your DNS

For each domain you add to Federalist, there are 2 DNS records that you (or your DNS administrators) must create before Federalist can serve your site at the chosen domain.

The details differ depending on the type of domain you would like to add.

- [Determine your domain type](#determine-your-domain-type)
- [Adding an apex domain](#adding-an-apex-domain)
- [Adding a subdomain](#adding-a-subdomain)

### Determine your domain type
An "apex" or "2nd level" domain is the "root" of your domain and will contain only one "`.`". A subdomain is any other domain and will contain more than one "`.`".

#### Examples

| apex domains  | subdomains           |
| ------------- | -------------------- |
| `example.gov` | `www.example.gov`    | 
| `18f.gov`     | `federalist.18f.gov` |

---

### Adding an apex domain

Because Federalist does not currently provide static IP addresses, in order for Federalist to serve a site at an apex domain your DNS provider must support `ALIAS` records. If they do not, you may require additional help for Federalist to be able to serve your site at that domain.

- [Your DNS provider supports `ALIAS` records](#your-dns-provider-supports-alias-records)
- [Your DNS provider does **not** support `ALIAS` records](#your-dns-provider-does-not-support-alias-records)

#### Your DNS provider supports `ALIAS` records

Then you only need to configure the following DNS records, replacing **`example.gov`** with your actual domain:

| type | name | value |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| `CNAME` | `_acme-challenge.`**`example.gov`**. | `_acme-challenge.`**`example.gov`**`.external-domains-production.cloud.gov.` |
| `ALIAS` | **`example.gov`**`.` | **`example.gov`**`.external-domains-production.cloud.gov.` |

#### Your DNS provider does **not** support `ALIAS` records
Federalist does not currently provide static IP addresses for which an `A` record can be used to direct traffic to your site. In this case you will have to utilize an external server that:
- is available at a static IP
- can redirect traffic from your apex domain to a subdomain (Ex. `example.gov` -> `www.example.gov`)
- includes an SSL certificate for the apex domain that you or your service provider acquires

If your agency or DNS provider has an available service, you (or they) can follow the following steps:

1. Obtain and install an SSL certificate for your apex domain on the "redirect" server
2. Configure the "redirect" server to redirect traffic from your apex domain to a subdomain (`example.gov` -> `www.example.gov`)
3. Configure the following DNS record, replacing **`example.gov`** with your actual domain and **`1.1.1.1`** with the actual IP address of your "redirect" server:

    | type | name | value |
    | ---- | ---- | ----- |
    | `A` | **`example.gov`**`.` | **`1.1.1.1`** |

4. Follow the instructions in [adding a subdomain](#adding-a-subdomain) for the subdomain to which you are redirecting.

---

### Adding a subdomain
Configure the following DNS records, replacing **`sub.example.gov`** with your actual domain:

| type | name | value |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
| `CNAME` | `_acme-challenge.`**`sub.example.gov`**`.` | `_acme-challenge.`**`sub.example.gov`**`.external-domains-production.cloud.gov.` |
| `CNAME` | **`sub.example.gov`**`.` | **`sub.example.gov`**`.external-domains-production.cloud.gov.` |

#### Minimizing downtime
It may take 5-10 minutes to provision an SSL certificate, so there will be a non-trivial amount of time between when the DNS records are created and when your site is live. To reduce the downtime, you can create the DNS records in two separate steps:
1. Create the `CNAME` record for the `_acme-challenge` subdomain as described above and notify Federalist support
2. Federalist support will notify you once SSL certificate has been issued
3. Create the `CNAME` record for your subdomain as described above

## Notify Federalist
Once your DNS changes are complete, notify Federalist support via:
- email: `federalist-support@gsa.gov`
- Slack: `#federalist-support`

Someone from the Federalist support team will assist you and make the updates to the Federalist platform.

---

## Update your site settings
Once the Federalist team has notified you that the platform changes are complete, update your Site Settings to reflect the new custom domain.

1. In the Federalist web application, navigate to the Site Settings page for your site by clicking on the `Site Settings` link on the lefthand navigation:

    ![Site Settings 1]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site-settings-1.png)

2. Under "Live Site" enter the branch name you want to associate to the custom domain and full url of the domain you just configured. When you are done, (scroll down if necessary and) click "save basic settings"

    ![Site Settings 2]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/site-settings-2.png)

3. Federalist will rebuild your site and then it will be available at the custom domain. If you notice that your site does not look correct and/or any site assets (css, js, images) appear to be missing, make sure that the urls to those assets are correct, we provide the environment variable `BASEURL` for this purpose. If using Jekyll, please make sure you use `site.baseurl` when constructing asset urls manually or use the `asset` helper tag if using the `jekyll-assets` gem.
