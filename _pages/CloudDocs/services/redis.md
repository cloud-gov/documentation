cloud.gov offers [Redis](http://www.redis.io/) 3.2 as a service.

## Plans

Service Name | Plan Name | Description | 
------------ | --------- | ----------- | -----
`redis32` | `standard-ha` | Redis instance with 10 GB storage | 

*Additional Cost:* Redis has a limit of 10GB in storage. After 10G, each additional gigabyte will cost $100 per month.




#### How to create an instance

To create a service instance, run the following command (replace `my-redis-service` with a name for the service):

```sh
cf create-service redis32 standard-ha my-redis-service
```

## HA client configuration

During platform maintenance each Redis instance in the cluster will be temporarily removed while it is being updated.  All clients connected to the instance will be disconnected during this process.

To ensure your application stays up during this process, configure your client to use a short (~ 1 second) timeout and to automatically reconnect to Redis when disconnected.

## Managing backups

The Redis service does not expose access to files generated by the Redis [SAVE](https://redis.io/commands/save) command. To back up data from your Redis instance, you can iterate over keys, fetch their values and expiration times using [DUMP](https://redis.io/commands/dump) and [TTL](https://redis.io/commands/ttl), and save them to a file. To restore, use the [RESTORE](https://redis.io/commands/restore) command for each saved key.

### Connecting to your Redis service locally

To facilitate backing up your Redis service, cloud.gov offers port forwarding if
SSH is enabled for your organization and application. Follow the following
instructions to create a service key and use it to set up a SSH tunnel.

Create a [service key](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/services/service-keys.html)
to access Redis credentials:

```sh
cf create-service-key my-redis my-key
```

Connect to your Redis service using port forwarding (see [Using SSH]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/management/using-ssh.md %})). You'll need to
leave the `cf ssh` command running
and follow the next steps in a different terminal so that you can access the
remote Redis instance from your local environment. These steps assume you have [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) installed locally.

```sh
redis_credentials=$(cf service-key my-redis my-key | tail -n +3)

redis_hostname=$(echo "${redis_credentials}" | jq -r '.hostname')
redis_port=$(echo "${redis_credentials}" | jq -r '.port')
redis_password=$(echo "${redis_credentials}" | jq -r '.password')

cf ssh my-app -L "6379:${redis_hostname}:${redis_port}"
```

You can now connect to your Redis service from your local machine using port `6379` and the password set to `$redis_password`, e.g. using the redis command line:

```sh
redis-cli -a "${redis_password}" -p 6379
```

## Rotating credentials

You can rotate credentials by creating a new instance and [deleting the existing instance](https://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/delete-service.html). If this is not an option, email [cloud.gov support](mailto:support@cloud.gov) to request rotating the credentials manually.
