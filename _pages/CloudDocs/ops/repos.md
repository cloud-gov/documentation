cloud.gov is built and maintained by 18F, which has an [open source policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/open-source-policy/) that guides our work: we use and develop open source software, and we encourage you to reuse and adapt our work.

cloud.gov is an open source project based on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) with additional components built by our team and other community members. This includes using open source for security: We use a combination of [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net), [Tripwire](https://github.com/Tripwire/tripwire-open-source) and [Snort](https://www.snort.org) on each system, with [OpenZAP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Zed_Attack_Proxy_Project) to do blackbox testing.  We also run [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) and a full [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack) with [ElastAlert](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert) for additional monitoring and alerting. We do use use a commercial tool for [CIS benchmarking](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/) and further blackbox testing. We welcome you to audit our security or contribute to it â€” or to make any other kind of contribution, from documentation to design. 

If you'd like to contribute security research, see our [vulnerability disclosure policy](https://18f.gsa.gov/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/).

You can also open an issue with your question in a relevant repository.
