## Sandboxes

New sandbox organizations are automatically created when users sign in for the first time, via the [sandbox bot](https://github.com/18F/cg-sandbox-bot).

## Non-sandboxes

Non-sandbox organizations need to be created by hand. To do so:

1. The [organization request form](https://docs.google.com/a/gsa.gov/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd4HmcGfJW3EBnpewTFDD-urRFPp1LN0DcwNB_FxZgUn8ho9g/viewform?c=0&w=1) should be filled out by a cloud.gov team member or the tenant.
1. After requesting an org, a cloud.gov Business Unit person must verify the org request and check that all the necessary info is there. They automatically receive a notification (it goes to Zendesk), but if they haven't responded yet and you need a response soon, ask in #cg-business for a cloud.gov Business Unit person to take a look. They will verify the info and note in the Zendesk ticket that a person on support rotation can go ahead and create it (this may be you if you have permission).
1. If you don't already have [`cg-scripts`](https://github.com/18F/cg-scripts), `git clone` or otherwise download it to your computer, because you'll use the [`cf-create-org`](https://github.com/18F/cg-scripts/blob/master/cf-create-org.sh) script for this step. Navigate to the `cg-scripts` directory, then copy and paste the command in column M of the [form output](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bdzl9n2E1MXWV4elXvZ-nYuZmmEj4PEU-u5aZlNGZF4/edit#gid=131031416) that corresponds to the appropriate row of the form â€” the spreadsheet should have automatically created the appropriate command using a formula. Using that script will automatically give the org the right name (column B + C).

1. [Make the primary (technical) point of contact an `OrgManager`.]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/orgs-spaces/roles.md %}#adding-roles-via-the-dashboard-for-users-to-access-orgs-and-spaces)
    * If they don't have an account yet, tell BU that they need to [invite them](https://account.fr.cloud.gov/invite) and ask them to accept the invite (and to let you know when they've accepted it). After they have an account, make them an OrgManager.

1. Check to make sure you're removed from any roles in the org that you automatically received.

1. Ask the BU to notify the `OrgManager` that the organization is created.
