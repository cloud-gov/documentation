## Make sure the user has a cloud.gov account

Anyone with a .mil or .gov account can [sign up for their own cloud.gov account]({{ site.baseurl }}/sign-up/) with a sandbox space in their agency's cloud.gov sandbox org.

To invite someone to a non-sandbox org, including federal employees and federal contractors without .gov or .mil email addresses, [send them an invite](https://account.fr.cloud.gov/invite). This may prompt you to log into your cloud.gov account first.

Then, confirm with them that they have received and accepted the invite. Now they have a cloud.gov account!

## Adding roles via the dashboard for users to access orgs and spaces

After a user has a cloud.gov account and has logged in, an Org Manager can assign roles using the [dashboard](https://dashboard.fr.cloud.gov/) as follows.
